    "# Stockyard\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, TACC users must make their files accessible to multiple systems. For that purpose, we have a large storage system called Stockyard. Each user has a home directory on Stockyard, contained inside of a mounted directory called `/$work`. Due to the sheer number of users, we have divided them into groups of 5 and assigned them a group number. For example, user `jchuah` might be the 104th user, therefore `jchuah` would be in group number 21. The user's home directory would be `/$work/21/jchuah`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program must read an input file named `stockyard.dat`. The first line is an integer *`N`* representing the number of test cases. The next *`N`* lines are test cases. Each test case is a username. After the test cases, there is another line containing an integer *`M`* representing the number of users on the system. The next *`M`* lines are usernames, in the order in which they were added to the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program must print out the home directory for each test case, in the format `/$work/<groupnumber>/<username>`. If a user does not exist, then print `dir not found`.\n",
