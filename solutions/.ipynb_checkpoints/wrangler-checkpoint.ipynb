    "# Wrangler\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrangler is a data intensive compute system, with extremely fast Solid State storage technology used for performing tasks on large data sets, such as images. A common task related to image data is extracting Regions of Interest, often based on blobs that may appear in an image. These regions are rectangular sub-regions of a larger rectangular image. For example, let's consider this black and white image:\n",

    "The Region of Interest is the smallest rectangle that can fully contain the blob.\n",

    "### Input\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program must accept input from the text file named `wrangler.dat`. The first line of the text file contains two integers, separated by a space. The first integer is the number of rows of image data, and the second integer is the number of columns in the image. The dimensions are followed by a matrix of integers, which contains a black and white image represented by `1` and `0` values separated by spaces. Each `1` and `0` value on a row is separated by a space, and each new row is on a new line of data.\n",
