    "Stampede was one of the fastest computing clusters in the world, when it was launched in 2012. It had `6,400` nodes. Each node had an onboard Xeon CPU with 16 processor cores, as well as an additional Xeon Phi Co-Processor add-on that added an additional 60 cores. Some nodes had GPU cores, as well. The entire system had `522,080` cores. \n",
    "\n",
    "Computing performance is measured in terms of how many quadrillion floating-point operations it could perform per second, otherwise known as *PetaFLOPS*. The entire system performed at 12 PetaFLOPS. Each Xeon Phi Co-Processor operated at a speed of 1 TeraFLOPS, or one trillion floating-point operations per second. Each Xeon CPU operated at a speed of 500 GigaFLOPS, or 500 billion floating-point operations per second.\n",
